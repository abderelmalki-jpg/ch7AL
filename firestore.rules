/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access with owner-only writes for products, prices, and stores.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable, but only updatable/deletable by the owner (if an owner field were defined).
 * - /prices/{priceId}: Stores price information, publicly readable, but only creatable/updatable/deletable by the owner (if an owner field were defined).
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store information, publicly readable, but only updatable/deletable by the owner (if an owner field were defined).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Public read access is allowed for products, prices, and stores to facilitate community-driven price comparison.
 * - Write permissions for products, prices, and stores are restricted to the owner (if an owner field were defined), but the schema does not currently define an owner.
 * - User listing is not explicitly denied, but the rules only allow access to specific user IDs.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `prices` collection includes the `userId` to directly associate a price with a user, avoiding the need for additional reads to the `users` collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while global data (products, stores) reside in top-level collections.
