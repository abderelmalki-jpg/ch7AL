/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Hanout Price application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and price entries.
 * Public read access is allowed for products and stores, but write access is unrestricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 * - /prices/{priceId}: Stores price information, owned by a user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store information, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Products and Stores are publicly readable. Write access is open to all authenticated users for prototyping.
 * - Price entries are owned by the user who created them.
 * - Listing of user profiles is denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /prices/{priceId} documents include the userId to enforce ownership, avoiding the need for `get()` calls to the /users/{userId} collection.
